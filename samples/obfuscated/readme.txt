"Poly Polymorphic Engine" is a programming library, created for data & code
encryption. It differs from other encryption libraries by its unique
functionality, that lies in its random encryption algorithm generation
that is build with random encryption commands, and as a final encryption
result, the OS independent decryption code in x86 Intel architecture is
attached to the encrypted data.

Sample encrypted files
================================================================================

In this example you can find modified version of a system utility Notepad,
where part of its executable code was encrypted with Poly Polymorphic Engine.

After its execution, control is transferred to the generated decryption code,
which decrypts the original data in the application code section and transfer
the control back to the OEP (Original Entry Point) and run the application.

You can find 3 code generation examples, each one is different from another,
so you can see how random polymorphic code generated by Poly engine can be.

I encourage you to analyze the polymorphic decryption code yourself. If you
don't know how, but you would like to learn - read my reverse engineering
analysis articles at:

Warning!
================================================================================

Please ignore any warnings from the anti-virus software, because files from
the archive can trigger so called false positive detection due to the
simplistic nature of code modifications in the executable.
